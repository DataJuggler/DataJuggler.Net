# DataJuggler.Net
DataJuggler.Net is a core component of several Data Juggler projects including DataTier.Net, DB Compare and XML Mirror.

For .NET5 - .NET9, use the version for that platrom.

.NET10 onward I am replacing the name to DataJuggler.NET.Data so I don't have to rebrand every version.
Younger me had too much time on my hand.

This project has been replaced by DataJuggler.NET.Data (coming by November 15 2025). 
Almost all new development will be on the DataJuggler.NET.Data.

This version DataJuggler.NET for .NET Framework is still used by DataTier.Net.
